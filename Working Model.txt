}

2)Database Data Persistence:
	The number values are stored in an Oracle database to ensure persistence even if the application is restarted.

3) Unit Testing:
	Implemented unit tests to verify the functionality of the API and its components.

Files and Components:
	1)Controller:
		Class: FetchNextNumberController.java
		Responsible for handling HTTP requests and delegating the logic to the service class.
	2)Service:
		Class: FetchNextNumberService.java
		Implements the business logic for fetching and generating the next number.
        3)DAO:
		Class: FetchNextNumberDAO.java
		Provides methods for accessing the database and performing CRUD operations.
	4)Entity:
		Classes: FetchNextNumberRequest.java and FetchNextNumberResponse.java
		Represent the request and response objects for the FetchNextNumber API.
