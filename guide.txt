===========================================

This guide provides instructions on how to use the FetchNextNumber API and outlines the
 features implemented in the minimal working model.

1. FetchNextNumber API

The FetchNextNumber API allows you to retrieve the current number and generate
 the next number based on the given requirements. Follow the steps below to use the API:

Endpoint: POST /FetchNextNumber

  "CategoryCode": "CATEGORY1"
}

Response:

  "oldValue": 10,
  "newValue": 19
}

2. Features Implemented

The minimal working model includes the following features:

- FetchNextNumber API: The API retrieves the current number from the database, generates the next number based on the requirements, and returns both the current and next numbers in the response.
- Database Data Persistence: The number values are stored in an Oracle database to ensure persistence even if the application is restarted.
- Unit Testing: Unit tests have been implemented to verify the functionality of the API and its components.
